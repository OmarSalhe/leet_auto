Medium,916. Word Subsets,py
'''You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.
    - b is a subset of a iff freq1[i][k] >= freq2[j][k]
        - i.e. the frequency of letter k in k ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         the i/jth word

For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".
    - does order matter? -> is 'rrw' a subset of 'warrior'

A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.
    - a is universal if b is always subset of a

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.
    - len(universal) >= len(words1)


given two arrays: words1, words2; return all strs in words1 where any could form a str in words2

Decision:
words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
freq =  0 -> a=2, m=1, z=1, o=1, n=1
        1 -> a=1, p=2, l=1, e=1
        2 -> f=1, a=1, c=1, e=1, b=1, o=2, k=1
        3 -> g=2, o=2, l=1, e=1
        4 -> l=1, e=3, t=1, c=1, o=1, d=1
    
words2[0][0] -> apple, facebook, google, leetcode (i = 0 contains no e)
words2[1][0] -> amazon, facebook, google, leetcode (i = 1 contains no o)

only 3 match -> facebook, google, leetcode

can stop considering a string the moment it fails any
    - needs to have enough to accomodate all -> to be universal all str must contain max of all necessary letters in words2

store max freq of letters in words2 (freq1)
store freq of letters for all words in words1 (freq2)

if freq2[word][c] < freq1[c] -> can omit from univ
return remaining str'''

Medium,1400. Construct K Palindrome Strings,py
'''
Given a string s and an integer k, return true if you can use all the characters
in s to construct k palindrome strings or false otherwise.
    - palindrome = symmetric
        - each letter (except center in odd case) must occur at least twice
        i.e. len(pal) -> even: all letters occur twice
                      -> odd: all letters occur twice except for one
    - palindromes don't need to match
        i.e. can derive at least one palindrome from an existing palindrome
        e.g pal = acbca becomes b, acca
                = acca becomes aa, cc
            - could be used recur on an existing palindrome
    - if k == n, all letters can be used to form palindrome
    - something to do with letter occurences
    - how to know if a palindrome forms:
        - all letters can form pairs with an outlier of one

Decision:
s = "annabelle", k = 2
pairs = a, n, e, l
single = b

k = 2 -> pop b -> k = 1 -> no singles remain, resulting str is a palindrome


s = "leetcode", k = 3
pairs = e
single = l, t, c, o, d

len(single) > k -> impossible to form k palindromes from cur str

Generalized:
get freq of every letter

for f in freq:
    pairs += count pairs in f
    single += count remainder after pairing

if single - 1 > k : -> subtract by one since you can designate one individual letter to still form a valid pal
    impossible
else:
    possible

TC = O(n)
SC = O(26)

test on s = abacdc, k = 2
pair = a, c
single = b, d

single - 1 < k -> possible

    def canConstruct(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:

        n = len(s)

        odd_n = sum(v & 1 for v in nums.values()) # count of numbers with a 1 bit -> odd numbers -> single numbers
