# leet_auto v1.0.0

leet_auto is an automation script designed to streamline the process of managing LeetCode solutions. It processes stored metadata and solutions (in any language), automatically organizing them into a structured file hierarchy within an external repository or directory (with minor tweaks).

Developed after solving 100+ LeetCode problems, this script simplifies tasks like file creation, organization, and pushing solution to a remote repository. The goal is for users to compile a list of solutions and let the script handle the test, with minimal intervention required to ensure there are solutions to process.
